# Blackjack Lite
## Overview
This is an implemenation of the popular card game Blackjack with a few modifications for simplicity. These modifications include:
* Users can only hit/stand, there is no doubling down or splitting
* There is no insurance for dealer Blackjacks
* There is a 2x bonus for user Blackjacks
* Aces are always treated as 11 (so dealer does not hit on a typical soft 17)

The implementation utilizes Node.js to create a back-end API for some commont requests, as well as using traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
Please note that this implementation does some user checking, but there are ways to "break the game". Additionally, the application uses
timers so in order to have the best experience make sure to allow the timers to take their full time.
